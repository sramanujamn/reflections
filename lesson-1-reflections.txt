version-control helps us to quickly resolve issues.

having the entire history enables you to make changes and if major then could easily rollback.

auto commit like google docs is useful for online word docs, spreadsheets etc., but would not be useful for codes. 
manual commit is best for maintaining codes, but at the same time we should ensure we are responsible enough to commit.

git is used to track projects. And in projects change in one file could affect other files that are related.
So committing multiple files in one single commit is beneficial.

we can use git log to get the full history of the commits done.

we can use git diff to get the details of the changes done between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

The ability to restore back to a previous working version gives us the confidence.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For now, will use it for the Udacity projects.
