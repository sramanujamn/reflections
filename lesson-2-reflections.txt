What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the .git metadata directory in the folder. We need to do it to enable version control for the files within the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is on which git will perform its tasks. We can specifically choose which files we need to add to the repository and which we do not need to.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We can just add the relevant files related to a change to the staging area and then commit it.
