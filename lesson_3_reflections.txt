When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i need to collaborate on a project with a team. The team could be based in remote locations. Also i could use a remote repository when
i want to publish content which others in the public can use/contribute.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically updated our local copy with the remote repository then this could cause any changes made on local to get overridden which may not be
desired by us. We should be having control on what changes we want to be done on local/remote and when.
